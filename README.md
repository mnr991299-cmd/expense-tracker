# Expense Tracker Project

## Project Overview
This is a Python-based Expense Tracker that helps users manage their daily expenses easily. You can add expenses, view all your records, filter by category or month, and calculate total spending. The program saves all data in a file, so nothing is lost when the program is closed.


## Features
- Add expenses with date, category, amount, and description  
- View all expenses in a clean table format  
- Calculate total expenses  
- Filter expenses by category  
- Filter expenses by month and year  
- Sort expenses by date or amount  
- Persistent storage using `expenses.txt`  


## How to Use 
1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your computer.  
2. Open the terminal or command prompt in the project folder.  
3. Run the program with the command:
    


4. Follow the menu options to add, view, filter, and sort expenses.


5. All data is automatically saved in expenses.txt.

##Requirements

Python 3.x

No additional libraries required



##Notes

Make sure main.py and expense_manager.py are in the same folder.

Use consistent category names (like Food, Travel, Bills) for accurate filtering.

The program automatically creates expenses.txt if it doesn’t exist.

Include screenshots and recordings in their respective folders for submission.



##Future Enhancements

Export expenses to CSV for Excel analysis

Graphical visualization of expenses

Monthly budget notifications

Adding a GUI interface for better user experience
